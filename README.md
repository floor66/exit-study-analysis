R analysis file for the EXIT meta analysis Shiny tool

Contains the R code that was used in the study analyses.

Two tools were developed using [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/). They allowed us to rapidly perform summary and comparative analyses on all combinations / groups in the study dataset. The study dataset consisted of manually extracted data from previously published clinical studies.

These tools can be re-used in future meta analyses and greatly speed up the process of analysis and creating figures for publication.
